[An interesting artical about Roblox and game development](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-roblox/)

<p> For those who don't know Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system. <br>

In recent years many people have made start ups to compete against Roblox. This artical explains how Roblox esentially 
has a monopoly on the market and how 99% of these start ups will most likely fail. Although Roblox seems silly and seems like 
it would be an easy market to take over, to even be competitive with the company would take a large amount of investment that
most small start ups just don't have. </p>

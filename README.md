[An interesting artical about Roblox and game development](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-roblox/)

<p> For those who don't know Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system. <br>

In recent years many people have made start ups to compete against Roblox. This artical explains how Roblox esentially 
has a monopoly on the market and how 99% of these start ups will most likely fail. Although Roblox seems silly and seems like 
it would be an easy market to take over, to even be competitive with the company would take a large amount of investment that
most small start ups just don't have. </p>

Really nice article. I feel like the chicken and egg problem is what most platforms struggle with. I feel like this kind of applies to social media apps as well. In order to get more people to use your platform you need people to use it from the start. Unless you do something like Mixer did during their start, it's very difficult to gain any form of traction. Kind of sad considering how difficult it is for start ups to compete against these monopolies.
